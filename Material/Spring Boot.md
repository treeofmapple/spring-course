## 1. Introduction to <strong>Spring Boot</strong>
---

 #### <p style="text-align:center;">What is Spring Boot? </p>

Spring framework is a small lightweight application development framework, upon many spring projects are based.

Spring boot is application accelerator and it seamless combines multiples spring projects together into a single pre configured code base for developes build upon.

Developed by an Australian named Rod Johnson in 2004.
Simplifiying the lifecycle of java components that have complex lifecycles, and help to externalize the configuration of the components that have complex configurations.

For example database connectors, kafka message queue, transaction management.

#### <p style="text-align:center;">Advantages over traditional Spring Framework? </p>

1. **Auto-Configuration** üîß
    
    - No need for extensive XML or manual bean configuration.
        
    - Automatically configures beans based on dependencies.
        
2. **Embedded Servers** üñ•
    
    - Comes with **Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow** embedded.
        
    - No need to deploy WAR files manually.
        
3. **Reduced Boilerplate Code** ‚úÇÔ∏è
    
    - Removes excessive XML configurations.
        
    - Uses annotations like `@SpringBootApplication` for quick setup.
        
4. **Production-Ready Features** ‚úÖ
    
    - Built-in health checks, metrics, logging, and monitoring.
        
    - `spring-boot-actuator` for real-time application insights.
        
5. **Faster Development & Deployment** üöÄ
    
    - Supports **microservices** & REST API development out-of-the-box.
        
    - Convention-over-configuration speeds up project setup.
        
6. **Spring Boot Starter Dependencies** üì¶
    
    - Pre-configured dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, etc.).
        
    - No need to manually add each library.
        
7. **Standalone Applications** üéØ
    
    - Can be packaged as **JAR** instead of WAR.
        
    - Run directly with `java -jar yourapp.jar`.
        
8. **Spring CLI Support** üíª
    
    - Enables rapid prototyping with Groovy scripts.
        
9. **Externalized Configuration** üîÑ
    
    - Supports YAML, `.properties`, and environment variables for easy customization.
        
10. **Seamless Integration with Cloud & DevOps** ‚òÅÔ∏è
    

- Compatible with **Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP**.
    
- Spring Cloud for distributed systems.

### ‚ùå When NOT to Use Spring Boot?

- If you need a **lightweight** application with minimal dependencies.
    
- If you prefer **manual configuration** and fine-tuned control over Spring components.
    
- If your project is **monolithic** and does not require embedded servers.

### 2. Core Features on <strong>Spring Boot</strong>

- Spring Boot starters & dependencies
    
- Auto-configuration & Spring Boot annotations
    
- Application.properties vs. application.yml
    
- Profiles for different environments

<br>

### 3. Building a REST API with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>

- Creating REST controllers
    
- Request mapping (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    
- Handling JSON with Jackson
    
- Exception handling

<br>

### 4. Data Persistence with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>

- Spring Data JPA
    
- Connecting to databases (H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    
- CRUD operations with Spring Repository
    
- Querying with JPQL and Native Queries
    
- Using Flyway/Liquibase for database migrations

- Caching with Spring Cache
